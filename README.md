# Chatbot-Discord
This is a bot in discord that reads all messages not sent by it and attempts to answer it with a chatbot.

## How it Works
The way this program works is by taking the newest input on the server it is on, checking whether the message was sent to itself and then sends the message to a chatbot. The chatbot, who starts with no knoledge, sends a reply to the message.
